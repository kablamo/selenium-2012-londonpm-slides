== Selenium and Perl
== Eric Johnson (@kablamo)


----
== What is Selenium?

+- A tool for testing your website
+- Written in Java
+- Similar to Test::WWW::Mechanize
+- But tests at the browser level
+- Exercises your JavaScript
+- Tests your site in any browser


----
== Selenium IDE

+- Firefox plugin
+- Designer can create tests
+- Records your actions in the browser
+- Replays them


----
== Demo


----
== Problems

+- Unreliable tests
+- It's not Perl (it's Selenese)
+- Repetition: can't easily use libraries
+- Lack of automation


----
== Unreliable tests

+problem: waitForPageToLoad
         does not handle ajax requests

+solution: waitForTextPresent


----
== Problems

x Unreliable tests
- It's not Perl (it's Selenese)
- Repetition: can't easily use libraries
- Lack of automation


----
== Test::WWW::Selenium


----
== 4 ingredients

+1. Perl test
+2. Selenium server
+3. Web browser
+4. Website
